style=\"text-indent:4em\">\n          “严谨、求精、勤奋、奉献”协和精神是协和的核心价值观，是协和医院文化精髓。协和文化以崇尚科学、崇尚知识、专业态度和专业精神为其思想内核，又具有深厚的人文特征，表现方式凝重、内敛、不张扬、戒浮躁，重视口碑效应。具体体现在协和人身上就是科学严谨的作风、浓厚的人文传统与学术的包容性。正如董炳琨老院长所说，协和精神，追求其渊源，则是两大主意识流汇合的结晶。一是忠于科学的事业精神，一是忠于人民的奉献精神。<br/></p>\n        <p style=\"text-indent:4em\">协和精神体现在每一位协和人的思想和行为中，通过耳濡目染、言传身教，代代相传。纪念老一辈协和人，就是继承协和的光荣传统。多年来医院从不间断举办各种纪念大会、演讲比赛、青年志愿者等各种活动，强化对员工的协和精神教育，近年来医院大力加强院报、网站等文化载体建设，借助大众媒体，加强对协和精神、协和文化的传播。在协和文化指导下，医院文化的子文化——科室文化近年来也得到不断的丰富与发展。<br/></p>  \n        <p style=\"text-indent:4em\">医院在医、教、研、管理各项活动中，以自己特定的方式蕴育、培养、积淀着协和精神、协和文化、协和人才。协和八十多年来形成的文化传统，凝聚了协和内部的各种力量，引领协和人向着以人为本、以病人为中心的目标和方向一往无前。</p>\n        <span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#75604F\">协和三宝：教授、病案、图书馆</span>\n        <p style=\"text-indent:4em\"> 协和有“三宝”，教授、病案、图书馆。协和的病案蕴藏着医院极为丰富和宝贵的临床资料，是协和人医疗技术、经验、临床思维过程的记录和结晶，也是医院开展教学和科研的基石。一些名人病历已成为宝贵的历史资料</p>\n        <span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#75604F\">协和传统“三基三严”的由来</span>\n        <p style=\"text-indent:4em\">962年，学校在《旧协和医学院教学工作经验初步总结》中，提出了著名的“三基、三严”原则。在学习上要重视“三基”即基础理论、基本知识、基本技能；在学习工作、科学研究上要强调“三严”，即严肃的态度、严格的要求、严密的方法。协和医院至今坚持以“三基、三严”为医学教育和人才培养的准则。</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"culture\">\n         <span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#75604F\">百年协和内涵</span>\n         <p style=\"font-size:24px;margin-top:60px;\">学术协和</p>\n         <p style=\"margin-top:20px\">创新：尊重科学
